To remove all containers and images from Docker, follow these steps:

🛑 Warning: This will remove all running and stopped containers, as well as all images from your system. Be sure you want to do this before proceeding.

1️⃣ Stop all running containers (optional)
If you have running containers, stop them first:
=====> docker stop $(docker ps -q)


2️⃣ Remove all containers
Remove both running and stopped containers:
=====> docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

If you encounter errors, use the force flag:
=====> docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
3️⃣ Remove all images


Now, delete all images:
====> docker rmi $(docker images -q)


If some images fail to delete due to dependencies, force remove them:
====> docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)

4️⃣ Remove all unused volumes (optional)
If you want to remove all Docker volumes as well:
===> docker volume prune -f

5️⃣ Remove all Docker networks (optional)
To clean up unused networks:
====> docker network prune -f


6️⃣ Remove everything in one command
If you want to completely clean Docker, removing all containers, images, volumes, and networks:
====> docker system prune -a --volumes -f


docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
